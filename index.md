1. Feature evolution during training process in nural network. How does neural network works. 
2. Investigating the Feature evolution in each layer of deep neural network works. 
3. We are investigateing the Feature evolution for each epoch right now and we could investiage the feature evolution in each layer for each epoch. 
4. Maybe investigae different type of neural network works.
